# Jobvio
This is a final semester project made by me and my other 3 teammates. We were supposed to make a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. 
We have made a website similar to Indeed, where job postings are handled by the website and job seekers can search for the jobs to get relevant information.
It is hosted locally on the Wamp server.
